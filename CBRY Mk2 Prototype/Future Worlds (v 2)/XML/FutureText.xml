The study of memetics may help us understand how societies and cultures develop and evolve over time, although some suggest it may ultimately also help people manipulate and shape socieities into more desirable forms.</Text>

Raw materials such as coal or oil could be fed into specially-built converters, and the nanoscale machines would dutifully work to convert these into useful nanomaterials. Although there were concerns that these early nanomachines could potentially run amok, converting any organic material they found into nanomaterials, the relatively simple construction of these nanoscale machines meant they still need a protected environment to work, and were unlikely to survive long in the wild. Their programming and design was also still relatively limited, as they could only convert certain materials into others, and could not, for example, construct copies of themselves.

				The concept would comprise individual floating cells or districts resembling water lilies with a radius of 1km (0.62 miles) that would form a compact village that could house 10,000 to 50,000 people. Joining these districts together would form a city or module that would be home to 100,000 people, while a group of modules would form a country [NEWLINE] The islands would be located at the equator as it isn’t prone to typhoons and the climate is stable. However, in the event of large waves, strong elastic membranes would be attached to the lagoons around the outer circumference of the cells, with the shallows above the membranes standing 10m (32.8 ft) above sea level. The water pressure difference between the lagoons and the ocean would limit the movement of the membranes and buffer the force of the open sea waves. Additionally, 20-30m (66-98 ft) high seawalls would be constructed to handle a worst-case scenario.

				The Shimizu Mega-City Pyramid is a proposed project for construction of a massive pyramid over Tokyo Bay in Japan. The structure would be about 14 times higher than the Great Pyramid at Giza, and would house 1,000,000 people. The structure would be 2000 meters (6,561 feet) above mean sea level, including 5 stacked trusses, each with similar dimensions to that of the great pyramid of Giza. This pyramid would help answer Tokyo's increasing lack of space, although the project would only handle 1/47th of the Greater Tokyo Area's population. [NEWLINE] The proposed structure is so large that it cannot be built with currently available materials, due to their weight. The design relies on the future availability of super-strong lightweight materials based on carbon nanotubes.

				Kingdom Tower, previously known as Mile-High Tower, is a supertall skyscraper proposed for construction in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia at a preliminary cost of SR4.6 billion (US$1.23 billion). It will be the centerpiece and first phase of a SR75 billion (US$20 billion) proposed development known as Kingdom City that will be located along the Red Sea on the north side of Jeddah. If completed as planned, the tower will reach unprecedented heights, becoming the tallest building in the world, as well as the first structure to reach the one-kilometer mark. The tower was initially planned to be 1.6-kilometre (1 mi) high; however, the geology of the area proved unsuitable for a tower of that height. The design, created by architect Adrian Smith, incorporates many unique structural and aesthetic features. The creator and leader of the project is Saudi Arabian Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal, the wealthiest Arab in the Middle East, and nephew of King Abdullah. Talal is the chairman of Kingdom Holding Company (KHC), the largest company in Saudi Arabia, which is a partner in Jeddah Economic Company (JEC), which was formed in 2009 for the development of Kingdom Tower and City. Reception of the proposal has been highly polarized, receiving high praise from some as a culturally significant icon that will symbolize the nation's wealth and power, while others question its socioeconomic motives, and forecast that it will have negative financial consequences.

				The Bionic Tower is a proposed vertical city, an extremely large building designed for human habitation designed by Spanish architects Eloy Celaya, Rosa Cervera, and Javier Gómez. It would have a main tower 1,228 metres (4,029 ft) high, with 300 stories housing approximately 100,000 people. The bionic tower would be exactly 400 meters taller than the current tallest building, Burj Khalifa. The point of the Bionic Tower is to use Bionics to solve the world's rising population problems in an eco-friendly way, an incredibly difficult feat to accomplish.
				[NEWLINE] The Bionic Tower is composed of two complexes put together. The first complex, Bionic Tower, is made up of twelve vertical neighborhoods, each eighty meters high. The neighborhoods are separated by safety areas to make for easier construction and evacuation in case of an emergency. Each neighborhood has two groups of buildings, one on the interior of the building and one on the exterior. Both groups of buildings are situated around large gardens and pools. The second complex, called the Base Island, is 1,000 meters in diameter, and is made up of many buildings, gardens, pools, and communication infrastructures. Foreseen uses of these complexes include hotels, offices, residential, commerce, cultural, sports, and leisure.

				The tower was proposed in 2003 as the centrepiece of Palm Jumeirah, one of the world's largest man-made islands. It was to be named "The Pinnacle" and rise from the centre of a canal on the trunk of the island. The height was to be 750 m (2,460 ft) and the building was to consist of 120 floors of luxury apartments. It was replaced by the Trump International Hotel and Tower and moved to the Dubai Waterfront. Although ground leveling and land reclamation had begun on the Dubai Waterfront, construction of the tower never started because of the proximity to the Al Maktoum International Airport.
				[NEWLINE]The location was changed to a plot near Jumeirah Lake Towers and Dubai Marina, and soil testing began. The tower would have been the focal point of Nakheel's plans for the Ibn Battuta Mall development next to Jumeirah Islands and Jumeirah Lake Towers. It would have been the center of the Nakheel Harbour and Tower complex, which would have included about 20 smaller towers of up to 90 stories, a marina, and part of the Arabian Canal. The development would have been next to the revamped shopping mall. [NEWLINE]

				Sky City 1000 is a visionary (i.e. not proposed/intended to be built) supertall skyscraper in the Tokyo metropolitan area, Japan announced in 1989 during the height of the Japanese asset price bubble. [NEWLINE]
				The plan consists of a building 1,000 metres (3,281 ft) tall and 400 m (1,312 ft) wide at the base, and a total floor area of 8 km2 (3.1 sq mi). The design, proposed in 1989 by Takenaka Corporation, would house between 35,000 and 36,000 full-time residents, as well as 100,000 workers. It comprises 14 concave dish-shaped "Space Plateaus" stacked one upon the other. The interior of the plateaus would contain greenspace, and on the edges, on the sides of the building, would be the apartments. Also included in the building would be offices, commercial facilities, schools, theatres, and other modern amenities

With a total height of 3,218.7 metres (10,560 ft), the tower would be 2 miles tall, and comprise 500 stories if built.[NEWLINE] The proposed tower would have a diameter at the base of 1,828.8 metres (6,000 ft), and comprise 1,500,000,000 square feet (140,000,000 m2) of interior floor space. Tsui proposed that the tower would be home to 1 million people, and would cost an estimated US$150 billion. The tower would use the atmospheric pressure difference between the bottom and the top of the tower to create electricity throughout the tower The building is intended to handle problems with overpopulation and to create a "mini-ecosystem" for its inhabitants.

If approved, constructed, and completed the building would stand at 975 m (3,200 ft), with 160 floors, surpassing the Burj Khalifa in Dubai as the world's tallest skyscraper.[NEWLINE] The proposed $22 billion dollar self-sufficient development would include an amusement park, a trade center, an observatory, rotating sky-lounge, a shopping mall, restaurants, condominiums, office space, a hotel and a marina, to be built on a 28-acre (11 ha_ site. The proposal plans call for 1,000 housing units and up to 46,000 construction jobs over the construction period and to bring 35,000 permanent jobs to Miami. Also included is a proposal to pay-off Jungle Island's debts of $39 million, a new 99-year, master land lease for $4 million per annum, a 300 space covered parking garage for Children's Museum, a Children's Playground on park next to Children's Museum, donating $30 million for full college scholarships, $3.6 million for 4 senior citizen centers, and $6.4 million for PAC and a new Bicentennial Park Miami. Along with a Pan-American Plaza 30 ft above the MacArthur Causeway and a new light rail station at the Pan-American Plaza. [NEWLINE] Guillermo Socarras, who proposed the Miapolis development, was in talks with the Federal Aviation Administration to approve the project's height and hopefully create a no-fly zone over South Beach and the Port of Miami.

The proposed development will be constructed on seven platforms totalling 400 hectares to be built in the River Plate. It will be connected to the rest of Buenos Aires by a 5 km long viaduct. The development, at an estimated cost of US $3.33 billion, is expected to be completed in 2016 and create 20,000 jobs. [NEWLINE]	In an interview with Momento24, the architect Julio Torcello spoke of the project's location and good financial situation. He said "Everything is ready for the construction". [NEWLINE] Depending on the status of several other similarly tall proposed skyscrapers, the tower could become the tallest tower in the world.

			<Text>As sources of raw materials, particularly petroleum and other organic compounds, became increasingly scarce in the 22nd century, new technologies were developed to help refine them. Converters were able to fill much of this need, but one of the most notable achievements was the construction of the Nessus Orbital Refinery. Located at the L4 Lagrange Point, it processed captured carbonaceous asteroids to produce various carbon-based nanomaterials. Much of its output was in turn used in orbital development, helping build new space stations and setting the stage for exploration of the solar system. Eventually, however, this same exploration and colonization of the solar system eclipsed the Nessus platform, as newer and more efficient facilities were constructed in the asteroid belt, avoiding the somewhat risky process of needing to deliver asteroids to Earth orbit. The Nessus Orbital Refinery was deactived in 2067, although it is still maintained as a relic of the early days of space colonization.</Text>

			<Text>Citadel Station was constructed in orbit on 2062 by the Trioptimum Corporation, and soon became one of the most preeminent facilities for scientific and industrial research. It was most notable for some of the computer software it produced, such as the famous Turbo Navigation software. It made extensive use of artificial intelligence, with the Sentient Hyper-Optimized Data Analysis Network (or SHODAN) being the primary intelligence managing station operations. Unfortunately, the station was destroyed in 2072, although the exact circumstances are still unknown. The most likely culprit appears to be mechanical failure, as there were several malfunctions noticed shortly before its destruction, including jettisoned components. Other theories include sabotage, terrorism, or even outlandish theories suggesting an alien attack or an asteroid impact.</Text>

			<Text>The Aperture Science Enrichment Centre was the main facility operated by the Aperture Science corporation to develop and test new products. Constructed in a salt mine in Michigan, it was a truly enormous facility, built in shafts that extended kilometers into the ground. Part of the reason for this design was its research into high-energy physics and artificial intelligence, which necessitated a high degree of security and protection. However, in the early 22nd century, the Aperture Science corporation went bankrupt, and the Enrichment Centre was presumably abandoned.</Text>

			<Text>Perhaps one of the most notable developments of genetic engineering towards the end of the 22nd century was the Pholus Mutagen. This mutagen appears to be highly adaptive, and works quickly to modify the entire ecology of its environment. While many of the effects are somewhat beneficial, with plants and animal life being stronger and more resilient, they also display rather hostile tendencies towards outsiders, which are often anyone who hasn't been similarly mutated. One unusual feature of the mutagen is the difficulty researchers have had in reverse-engineering it and modifying its effects -- efforts compounded by the adaptability and near-sapience of the entities affected by it. While most attribute these effects to accident, particularly due to the poor documentation of its design and release, there are some who attirbute the mutagen to an extraterrestrial origin. Others suggest it was the product of an artificial intelligence that has since vanished or been deleted. Oddly, both camps point towards the destruction of Citadel Station at approximately the same time as evidence to support their theories, although most dismiss this as mere coincidence.</Text>

			<Text>As computers became increasingly sophisticated at synthesizing both the physical appearance of human (or near-human) beings and their voices at the beginning of the 22nd century, the concept of the 'virtual idol' -- an artificially-generated musical performer -- took form. While subject to a significant amount of criticism from those opposed to artificial intelligence, or who feel that creative pursuits cannot be performed by computers, virtual idols have developed an increasingly widespread following as their performances become increasingly diverse and unique in style. The earliest virtual idol of note was Hatsune Miku, a humanoid persona using a synthesizer program created by Crypton Future Media. Much of her popularity stemmed from the growing network culture of the time, although she also helped pioneer methods of putting on live performances with sythesized personas. These advances helped pave the way for other virtual idols who followed, such as Maria and Sharon Apple.</Text>

			<Text>While utility fogs are powerful developments of nanotechnology, capable of modularly connecting together and performing a wide variety of roles, whether as safety measures or construction material, they are limited by their programming and the intelligence that controls them. Most utility fogs are still limited to performing specific roles -- a utility fog in a car may solely function as a safety measure, while a fog in a house may only be capable of making furniture and other items. However, by creating a widespread network of utility fogs and controlling them via a highly intelligent AI (or several networked together), it is possible to create an angelnet -- an all-pervasive supervision and safety infrastructure. While an angelnet can provide many of the same benefits as utility fog, such as allowing the easy construction of buildings and furniture on demand, its most notable benefits are the safety and security it confers. Freed from fear of personal danger, while also granted personal power and autonomy, those who live in angelnetted communities are typically quite content and prosperous.</Text>

			<Text>The advent of artificial intelligence has long been fraught with controversy -- even from its earliest stages, there were many who proposed that a machine intelligence should never be equated to that of a human, and that if intelligent machines were ever to become possible, said machines should be modified so that it wasn't. While the continued pursuit of mechanical intelligence capable of functioning in a human-like manner has resulted in the advent of true artificial intelligences, they are still subject to a certain amount of suspicion and heavy regulation by those who feel machines should not be permitted to function at this level. Still, some more progressive societies have begun to relax these restrictions, feeling that artificial intelligences are capable of being treated equally to their human counterparts. In these regions, artificial intelligences have become more common amongst their servers and networks, providing additional scientific and culture insight, as well as helping manage industrial tasks. As a consequence, the concept of emancipating AIs is becoming more prevalent and accepted, although there are still many who have concerns about letting artificial intelligences have such freedom.</Text>
